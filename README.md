# AI Software Developer POC

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered software development assistant that can:

1. Analyze project requirements and create a detailed architecture
2. Break down components into specific, actionable tasks
3. Generate implementation steps for each component

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the main script with a project description:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:

1. Analyze the project and create an architecture design
2. Generate a list of tasks for each component
3. Display the results in a structured format

## Example Output

For a task management web application, the output might look like:

```
Analyzing project architecture...

Architecture Analysis Complete!
Number of components: 4
Components:
- Backend API
  Description: REST API service handling data operations and authentication
  Dependencies: Database, Authentication

- Frontend UI
  Description: Responsive web interface for task management
  Dependencies: Backend API

- Database
  Description: Data storage for tasks, projects, and user information
  Dependencies: None

- Authentication
  Description: User authentication and authorization service
  Dependencies: Database

Generating implementation tasks...

Task Generation Complete!
Number of tasks: 12

Tasks by Component:
Backend API:
- [low] Set up project structure and dependencies
- [medium] Implement user authentication endpoints
- [medium] Create CRUD endpoints for tasks
- [medium] Create CRUD endpoints for projects

Frontend UI:
- [low] Initialize React project
- [medium] Create authentication forms
- [medium] Implement task management interface
- [medium] Create project management views
...
```

## Project Structure

- `project_analyzer.py`: Contains the core logic for project analysis and task generation
- `main.py`: Example script demonstrating the usage
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `.env`: Configuration file for API keys

## Limitations

This is a proof of concept and has the following limitations:

1. Generated tasks may need human review and refinement
2. The architecture design is based on the model's knowledge cutoff date
3. Some complex project requirements may need additional clarification

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for multiple architecture styles
2. Implement task dependency visualization
3. Add code generation for basic component structure
4. Include test case generation
5. Add project timeline estimation
